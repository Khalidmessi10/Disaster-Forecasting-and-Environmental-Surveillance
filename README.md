# 🌍 Sensor Fusion for Disaster Forecasting and Environmental Surveillance

This project is a Disaster Detection and Prediction System developed using Arduino Uno and various sensors to monitor critical environmental parameters such as earthquake activity, rain duration, temperature, humidity, CO2 concentration, and dust density. The system collects data in real-time and provides dynamic visualizations to aid in disaster preparedness and environmental surveillance.

- **Data Format:** CSV

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. **🔗 Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name

2. ** 🔌 Connect Arduino Uno:

- Attach the sensors to your Arduino Uno as per the project configuration.
- Ensure that the Arduino IDE is installed and properly set up on your machine.

3.## 🏃‍♂️ Run the tracker script:

1. Open the `tracker.py` file in Visual Studio Code.
2. If you encounter errors related to the CSV file path, replace the relative path with the absolute path in the script.
3. Execute the `tracker.py` script to start collecting sensor data:
   ```bash
   python tracker.py
4.##🚀 Launch the Streamlit App:

Open a terminal in the project directory.
Run the Streamlit application to visualize the collected data:
  ```bash
  streamlit run final.py

5.##🚀 Usage
📡 Data Collection:
The tracker.py script continuously collects sensor data from the Arduino Uno and appends it to the sensor_data.csv file.
📊 Data Visualization:
The Streamlit app (final.py) reads data from sensor_data.csv and provides interactive analytics and visualizations.
📂 File Descriptions
final.py:
A Streamlit application that reads the sensor_data.csv file and provides interactive data visualizations using Plotly, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
sensor_data.csv:
The CSV file where sensor data is stored. Each row represents a set of readings from the sensors at a given time.
tracker.py:
A Python script that collects real-time data from the sensors via the Arduino Uno and appends it to the sensor_data.csv file in a predefined format.
